The steps to completing this project are...
Set up GitHub Repo: COMPLETE.

Create a list of goals for movie-rec-rec-movie: COMPLETE.

Create a design with some pseudo-code to accomplish that list of goals for movie-rec-rec-movie: COMPLETE.

Create the data structures to contain the movie-rec-rec-movie code: COMPLETE.

Create the search function that returns data within data structures: COMPLETE.

Create a database of films in at least three different genres: COMPLETE.

-- BONUS ROUND --

Prompt the user to give input and check for films with specific tags: COMPLETE.
-- Additionally, idiot-proof the prompt so it only allows certain queries: COMPLETE.

Create a system for searching multiple tags at once: COMPLETE.

-- DONE --

I'm pretty satisfied that this proves I can use data structures in Python. Other features that could be added if I wanted to push this further...
+ Short film descriptions (1-3 sentences) that would describe each film.
+ Returning which genres a film belongs to for multi-genre searches.

As it stands, though, I won't be adding these today. Maybe I'll come back to this project and add them at a later date. For now, I'm good.
