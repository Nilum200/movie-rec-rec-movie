# Here is the class/function that handles grabbing tags from the user.
# Those tags are then fed into mov_films to return a list of films which fit the user's tag preferences.

# class Chooser:
# The init function should initialize a tag holder that holds the tag the user chooses. For now, it holds None.
#   def __init__(self):
#       self.tag = None

# Sci-Fi = 1, Fantasy = 2, Horror = 3, Comedy = 4, Superheroes = 5.
#   def choose(self):
#       valid_choices = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
#       choice = None
#       while choice is not a valid choice:
#           choice = input("Choose: ")
#           choice will loop until a valid choice is presented.
#       int_choice = int(choice)
#       return int_choice
#       convert choice into an integer, which is then returned for use in the linked_list film search function.
