These should be fairly simple.

- Compile a list of movies within the following categories...
-- Fantasy.
-- Science Fiction.
-- Horror.

^- These are forms of data that can be stored in a data structure.

Then, recommend a movie based on someone's chosen preferences.

^- This will require an algorithm to sort or search for data within a data structure.

It's *that* simple. Keep It Simple, Stupid! If you feel like adding more to it after that, then do so.
