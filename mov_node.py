# The node class contains the name of the film, genre tags for the film, and a link to the next node.

# class node
# def __init__(self, film, tag)
#   film should be the film's title. The "tag" is used as a search filter.
#   There should also be a self.next_node = None here, so we can set it later for the linked list to function.

# def get_film(self):
#   return film title.

# def get_tag(self):
#   return the tag, like sci-fi or fantasy. This will later be used by a linked list's search function.

# def set_tag(self, tag):
#   set a film's tag. If I'm feeling *really* ambitious, I might try to make it a list containing multiple tags.

# def get_next_node(self):
#    return next node, used in search function to access and continue down the node chain.

# def set_next_node(self, next_node):
#    set the next node so the linked_list daisy chain continues to function.
